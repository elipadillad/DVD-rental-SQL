# DVD-rental-SQL

This project is about using SQL to explore the DVD rental database and answer **specific questions about the customer's behavior**. 

Four insights are represented in the _Project SQL Presentation.pdf_ file

Each slide has a specific code at the bottom which is the same as in the _project.sql_ file (containing all the SQL code that I wrote)

## Files used
* Sakila DVD Rental database
